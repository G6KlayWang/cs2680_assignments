"""Your agent. Everything in src/ is yours: replace this starter with your own design.

madsOpt.py (course code) builds the dispatcher client and calls

    Agent(dispatcher).run()

That is all it needs from src/. This starter only shows how to use
what the course provides. It makes no attempt to fix anything, so every task fails until you
write your agent:

- the dispatcher (dispatcher/dispatcher.py) opens tasks and grades patches: Agent.run() and
  Agent.solve() below show every call;
- a Sandbox (src/sandbox.py) is the only way to read, write or run anything in a task's
  repository, which lives in its own task container;
- the course API (environment variables: CS2680_BASE_URL, CS2680_API_KEY and the model ids
  CS2680_MODEL_EXPERT / CS2680_MODEL_STANDARD / CS2680_MODEL_STARTER) is used by call_model() below;
- the trace (dispatcher.logger(k)) must get every model call and every tool call: the
  leaderboard computes your cost and turn counts from it.
